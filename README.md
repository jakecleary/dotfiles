# dotfiles

Currently a simple backup of some config files I care about.
This does not do anything fancy, like automated installation or backup.
It's just a bunch of copy-pasted files, and a list of programs I usually
install using homebrew, etc.

For the CLI, I use...

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/invocation/) as my terminal emulator
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as my shell
- [starship](https://starship.rs) as my prompt

I also use [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) to interact with 
git repos without straying too far from the command line.
